Description: round-robin scheduler

System overview:
	producer (P)
	worker1 (W1)
	worker2 (W2)
	Message queue: job

	P --> |||||||j3|j2|j1| 	--> W1 gets j1
              job           --> W2 gets j2
                            --> W1 gets j3

Observations:
	You need three consoles, one for each participant

worker1:
	$ python3 worker.py

worker2:
	$ python3 worker.py

producer:
	$ python3 producer.py <a_string_with_an_arbitrary_number_of_dots>

	Number of dots indicates the time (in seconds) that job require the job to complete
	Example: python3 producer job1.... job2. job3...
      - job1 requires 4 seconds
      - job2 requires 1 seconds
      - job3 requires 3 seconds
